    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a software developer with extensive experience in desktop application development, primarily in C# and Delphi, where I have created reliable and functional systems for various business needs. In addition, I actively work with .NET Framework/.NET Core, using the power of these platforms to build scalable and sustainable solutions. My knowledge also includes working with MS SQL databases - from schema design and query optimization to application integration. In my work, I rely on Microsoft Visual Studio as my primary development environment, which allows me to program and debug efficiently.
            Although my main focus is on desktop technologies, I also have experience in building web interfaces using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6+), with knowledge of modern frameworks such as React and Blazor. I actively use Git and version control to maintain code quality and team collaboration. My goal is to combine these technologies to deliver applications that are stable, fast, and easy to maintain, with a strong emphasis on the long-term sustainability of the codebase.
            In addition, I have experience in Oracle EPM (Enterprise Performance Management) development and implementation, including configuration, integration, and customization of financial process management and planning solutions. This allows me to support organizations in optimizing business processes, improving reporting, and making more effective decisions through advanced EPM tools.
